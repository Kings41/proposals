# Welcome to the WICG Proposals Repo!

Previously, we invited all discussions and suggestions/proposals for the web platform to be
started on the [WICG's discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/) site with the intent that the 
broadest possible community might have a chance to review and provide feedback.

Now, in recognition that Github has a (probably larger) community of web developer 
interest, we are beginning the transition to use this repo as an additional home
for community discussions and proposals.

# Getting Started

Head over to the [issues list](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues) and search for a topic
of interest. If you don't find anything there, consider starting a new issue. You are also welcome
to head over to [Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/) and participate there as well. 

(For simplification, we'd like to encourage a center of gravity on Github, but this is by no means 
a requirement, and it may take some time before there is sufficient content and participation in
this repo.)

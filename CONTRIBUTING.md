# Welcome to the Web Platform Incubator Community Group (WICG) Proposals Repo

This repository is a \[new] alternative to using [Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/) for
suggesting and discussing any and all proposals for the web platform.

As [noted previously](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/welcome-to-wicg-discourse/6) on Discourse:

> A decade ago, Web standards used to be created behind closed doors. Then they moved into the
> open, with public mailing list discussions and bug trackers. Then a growing number of 
> specifications started moving to open source repositories (typically GitHub) where they can
> be tracked, modified, and in some cases even [forked](http://berjon.com/blog/2014/05/is-html-too-big-to-fail.html).
>
> Yet contributing to standards remains hard. You have to find the specification (and get the
> right one amongst many different documents), find the group that is in charge of it, look
> through mailing list archives to see if your feedback has been sent before, post to a mailing
> list, etc.
>
> \[We hope that by providing this repo directly on Github] to make starting and pursuing
> conversations about Web standards much easier. \[You probably already have a Github account],
> searching [the issue list] for a similar topic should just work, and if nothing is there you 
> can just post [a new issue]. If there is no matching category, just post without and we’ll add it.
>
> Basically, if you have anything to say about Web standards, be it a new feature or feedback on an
> existing one, just say it!
> 
> Let’s [Spec The Web Forward](https://movethewebforward.org/)!
